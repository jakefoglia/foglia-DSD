# Test Directory
This contains various vhdl files and directories for practicing VHDL design
Files with names ending in '_tb' are test benches for their corresponding VHDL designs

There is a batch script called run.bat which takes 1 argument, the name of the vhdl file you wish to run with no extension. There should be a corresponding test bench with the same name, but with _tb at the end. 

For example to run ch13_1.vhdl and ch13_1_tb.vhdl, simply open a terminal in the ch13 directory and type the following command : run ch13_1
